# Adversarial Attack and Defence for ML Algorithms

Examined robustness against adversarial attack as well as
improved it through mechanisms for adversarial defense, for the following classification
algorithms: (a) Linear SVM, (b) Logistic regression, (c) Softmax regression, (d) Decision tree, (e)
Weighted kNN, (f) An ensemble of these.
